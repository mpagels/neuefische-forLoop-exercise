/* 
You have a list of names. I want that you loop over that list and console.log the names with an addition

Output in the console:

Hello John, welcome to the server
Hello Michael, welcome to the server
Hello Jerry, welcome to the server
Hello Alex, welcome to the server
Hello Holden, welcome to the server

Remember: You can concatenate strings:

const firstName = "Martin"
const lastName = "Pagels"
const fullName = firstName + " " + lastName
console.log(fullName) // "Martin Pagels"
Use everything the for loop is giving you ;-)

*/

const nameList = ["John", "Michael", "Jerry", "Alex", "Holden"];
